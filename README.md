# ANALOG-INPUT-AND-INTERRUPTS
This Arduino project reads analog values from a light sensor connected to pin A0 and displays them on a 16×2 RGB LCD in real time. It uses a push button connected to digital pin 2 to trigger an external interrupt (INT0). When the button is pressed, the interrupt service routine sets a flag that activates a buzzer on pin 8 for 2 seconds and displays a “Buzzer Active” message on the LCD. After the buzzer turns off, the program continues monitoring the light sensor and updating the LCD. The project demonstrates using interrupts for responsive input handling, reading analog sensor data, and controlling digital output devices simultaneously on an Arduino.
